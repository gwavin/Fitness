    <h1>Kihon Ippon Kumite – Full Directions</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> "Kihon Ippon Kumite" is the basic one-step sparring drill in Shotokan karate. One person delivers a predefined attack, and the partner counters with a block and a single decisive counter-attack. Practicing from both sides builds correct stances, breathing, etiquette, and awareness. The techniques below are split into units for easier study, and colors inspired by Shotokan (reds and earthy tones) highlight each section.</p>
    
    <div class="sidedness-note">
        <strong>Sidedness Note:</strong> In Shotokan karate, all techniques in Kihon Ippon Kumite are practiced from both sides (right side lead; left side lead) to develop balance and symmetry. The descriptions below assume a right-lead forward stance for the attacker (stepping back with the left foot to assume stance, then advancing with the right foot). For the left side, mirror all actions (step back with right foot, etc.). Partners switch roles after each repetition, and always bow before and after exchanges. Emphasize focus at the end of each technique, with proper awareness maintained throughout. Specific left/right details for arms and feet are noted inline for clarity.

        <h2>A. High-Level Lunge Punches (Jōdan Oi-Zuki)</h2>

        <h3>1. "Up-and-Over" – Jōdan Oi-Zuki #1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> Begin in the ready stance (yoi). Step your left foot straight back into a long forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi) while performing a downward sweeping block with the right lead arm (gedan barai). Immediately drive forward with the right foot, shifting your weight to the right front leg and delivering a high lunge punch (jōdan oi-zuki) with the right arm aimed at the opponent’s head. After the punch lands, withdraw by pulling the right front leg back and returning to the natural ready stance.</li>
            <li><strong>Defender:</strong>
                <ul class="defender-steps">
                    <li>Stay relaxed in the ready stance until the attack begins.</li>
                    <li>As the punch approaches, lift the right front arm into a rising block (age-uke) to shield the head.</li>
                    <li>Immediately counter by twisting the hips and punching with the left rear hand to the opponent’s mid-section (chūdan gyaku-zuki).</li>
                    <li>Hold the finishing posture briefly, then return to yoi.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. "Knife-Hand Intercept" – Jōdan Oi-Zuki #2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> Start from yoi. Step left foot back into a forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi), sweeping the right front arm down in a downward block. Immediately shift your body weight forward with the right foot and punch to the opponent’s head with a high lunge punch (jōdan oi-zuki) using the right arm. After impact, bring the right front leg back and return to the ready position.</li>
            <li><strong>Defender:</strong>
                <ul class="defender-steps">
                    <li>Remain in the ready stance.</li>
                    <li>As the punch comes in, rotate your torso to the left and place both hands vertical with the right lead hand acting as a knife-hand block (tate shuto-uke) while shifting the left foot back into back stance (kokutsu-dachi).</li>
                    <li>Immediately counter with the left rear hand by executing a high knife-hand strike (gyaku jōdan shuto-uchi) to the attacker’s neck.</li>
                    <li>Recover by bringing the left back leg forward to yoi.</li>

            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> From the ready stance, step left foot back into a forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi) with a downward sweep (gedan barai) using the right arm. Immediately thrust forward with the right foot, shifting your centre and performing a high lunge punch towards the head with the right arm. After striking, pull the right punching arm back and return your right front leg to the ready stance.</li>
            <li><strong>Defender:</strong>
                <ul class="defender-steps">
                    <li>Maintain yoi until the attack initiates.</li>
                    <li>As the punch nears, step to the left side with the left foot into a slightly closed stance and perform a side rising block (sokumen jōdan-uke) with the right arm to deflect the punch.</li>
                    <li>Without hesitation, lift the right leg (closest to the opponent) and execute a snapping side kick (yoko-geri keage) to the attacker’s ribs.</li>
                    <li>Land in horse stance (kiba-dachi) and finish with a right side elbow strike (yoko enpi-uchi) before returning to yoi.</li>

            <li><strong>Defender:</strong>
                <ul class="defender-steps">
                    <li>As the attacker moves forward, step back with the left foot into forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi) and cross your wrists (right over left) to form a back-hand X-block (haishu juji-uke).</li>
                    <li>Counter with a left roundhouse kick (mawashi-geri) using the left rear leg to the attacker’s ribs.</li>
                    <li>Grab their right wrist (te zukami) with your left hand to control their arm.</li>
                    <li>Then pivot on the right foot and deliver a left roundhouse elbow strike (mawashi enpi-uchi) with the left arm.</li>

                    <li>As the kick approaches, step back with the left foot and perform a reverse downward sweep (gyaku gedan barai) with the left arm, moving into forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi).</li>
                    <li>Counter with a jabbing punch to the face (jōdan kizami-zuki) with the right arm.</li>
                    <li>Then twist the hips and deliver a reverse punch to the torso (gyaku-zuki) with the left arm.</li>
                    <li>Finish by stepping back to the ready stance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. "Cross-Block Smash" – Mae-Geri #3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> Stand in yoi. Step left foot back into a forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi) with both fists lowered. Fire a mid-level front kick (chūdan mae-geri) with the left rear leg toward the defender’s abdomen. Replace the left foot forward in forward stance and then bring it back to return to the ready position.</li>
            <li><strong>Defender:</strong>
                <ul class="defender-steps">
                    <li>As the attack begins, draw the right front foot back into a long front stance (left zenkutsu-dachi), crossing your forearms (right over left) into a low X-block (gedan juji-uke) to catch and redirect the kick.</li>
                    <li>Immediately twist the hips forward and strike the attacker’s head with a double knife-hand strike (jōdan shuto juji uchi) using both hands.</li>
                    <li>Keep the feet planted in the stance during the strike.</li>
                    <li>Then step forward with the right rear leg to return to yoi.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Footwork note:</em> Stepping the front foot back lengthens your stance and loads the rear leg. After blocking and striking, bring the rear foot forward to reset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. "Cat-Stance Elbow" – Mae-Geri #4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> From yoi, step left foot back into forward stance (right zenkutsu-dachi) with hands low, then kick forward with the left rear leg using a mid-level front kick (chūdan mae-geri). Land forward with the left foot, then return the left front leg to yoi.</li>
            <li><strong>Defender:</strong>
                <ul class="defender-steps">
                    <li>Slide your body to the left side with the left foot into a cat stance (neko-ashi-dachi), and use a low sweeping block (gedan barai) with the right arm to deflect the kick.</li>
                    <li>Immediately execute a reverse vertical knife-hand strike (gyaku tate shuto-uchi) to the attacker's neck.</li>
                    <li>Land in horse stance (kiba-dachi) and deliver a right elbow strike (age enpi-uchi) to the face.</li>
                    <li>Return to yoi.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
