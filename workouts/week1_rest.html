    <h2>Week 1 – Rest & Barefoot Training</h2>
<p>Daily barefoot time indoors and basic foot‑strengthening exercises (calf raises, toe curls). If comfortable, walk barefoot on soft grass for 5–10 minutes. On two rest days, finish your walk with a short 200‑m barefoot jog【254645292719844†L139-L156】. Remember to progress slowly and listen to your feet; start on soft surfaces and stop if you feel pain【254645292719844†L139-L142】.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Keep warming up and cooling down even on rest days. Gentle stretching and mobility exercises will help your recovery.</p>
