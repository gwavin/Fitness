            <li><strong>Hamstring Stretch:</strong> Sit on the floor with your legs extended. Reach for your toes, keeping your back straight. Hold for 20-30 seconds.</li>

            <li><strong>Calf Stretch:</strong> Stand in a staggered stance and lean against a wall. Keep your back leg straight and your heel on the floor. Hold for 20-30 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
