    <h1>Eulogy for My Father</h1>
    <p>A loving husband, devoted grandfather, and steadfast friend.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        Today we gather to remember my father — a loving husband, a devoted grandfather, and a man whose life touched more people than any short reflection could hope to capture.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        In truth, his eulogy almost writes itself. Everyone I speak to has another story, another memory — enough to fill far more time than we have today. That alone tells you something important about him.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        He was taken from us far too soon. At seventy-one, it feels as though more time was owed. And yet, in the years he was given, he lived fully, wringing what feels like many lifetimes out of the life he had.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        He had a remarkable impact on everyone he met. He was a friend to all, always with a good word for everyone. But he offered more than words — he offered his hands and his time. Looking back, he performed an almost impossible number of good deeds for the people around him. If help was needed, he didn’t just offer; he turned up with tools and skill.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        In his career as a guard, he carried responsibility with fairness and humanity. He was measured in his judgement, never acting rashly or harshly, and never approaching people with malice. He retired young, almost twenty years ago, but never stopped being useful, practical, or generous with his time.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        Over years of working with colleagues and friends, he managed something rare: he moved through life without bitterness, without falling out, and without leaving problems behind him. To him, there was no problem that didn’t come with a solution.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        He was a complete messer, always having the crack, always ready with a laugh or a story, and always lifting the mood wherever he was. He was a renowned storyteller, not just because he exaggerated, but because he noticed people and moments; he never missed a detail and knew how to share them.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        He had many interests, but what stood out was the way he applied himself to them. Whether it was tug-of-war, golf, or welding — specifically trailers — he took real satisfaction in doing things properly and seeing them work. He believed in learning through doing, and he was always doing something.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        He was deeply proud of his family, including the five siblings he grew up with and remained very close to throughout his life. He was a loving husband to my mother, Maggie, and a devoted grandfather. To Mae, Mollie, James, and Ali, he was simply “Dicky” — a constant presence, a source of constant kindness and fun and games.</p>

      <p><span class="pause">Pause</span><br>
        We are grateful for the life he lived, for the laughter he brought, and for the example he set. We say goodbye today with love and thanks, and we wish him peace.</p>

      <section class="acknowledgements" aria-label="Acknowledgements for the service">
        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>On behalf of my mother Margaret and our family, we wish to express our sincerest thanks to the first responders, including An Garda Síochána and the fire brigade, as well as to neighbours, friends, and the wider community, for their kindness, help, and support during this difficult time.</p>
        <p>We would also like to thank the priest and altar servers who will celebrate today’s Mass, the church choir and Richard Carney for the music, and caretakers, and the undertakers, for their great care and support in helping us honour my father today.</p>
